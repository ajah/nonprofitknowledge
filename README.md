Description of the Nonprofit Knowledge Project

The Nonprofit Knowledge Project is an initiative launched by <a href="http://www.ajah.ca">Ajah</a>, in collaboration with <a href="https://montreal.dataforgood.ca/">Data 4 Good's Montreal chapter</a>, and Concordia University's, <a href="https://www.concordia.ca/faculty/elizabeth-bloodgood.html">Dr. Elizabeth Bloodgood</a>. Our hope is to attract volunteer data scientists to both the data assets and the research questions that could be used to answer important questions facing various stakeholders (e.g. grant officers, fundraisers, policymakers, program managers and executive directors) in the nonprofit sector. 

<a href="https://ajah.ca/">Ajah</a> is a social enterprise based in Montreal, Qc, founded in 2009. Ajah uses public and open data to help nonprofits make evidence-based decisions. They regularly use Open Data policies to help Canadian governments share key data assets about the nonprofit sector. In 2013, they launched a nonprofit initiative called <a href="https://www.PoweredbyData.org">Powered by Data</a>, which helps the nonprofits access the information assets they need to accomplish their mission. 

<a href="https://montreal.dataforgood.ca/">The Montreal Data for Good Chapter</a> is a community of data professionals who provide pro-bono data analytics services to registered charities and Not for Profit organizations.

<a href="https://www.concordia.ca/faculty/elizabeth-bloodgood.html">Dr. Elizabeth Bloodgood</a> is an Associate Professor and the Chair of the Department of Political Science at Concordia University. She is interested in the emergence and influence of international non-governmental organizations (INGOs) and the political power of expertise.
