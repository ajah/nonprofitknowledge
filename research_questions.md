# Research Questions for the Project


## Short-term research questions (To be presented at 16 October meeting)

- What new information can still be drawn out of the T3010 data?
   - predict receipt of gift?
   - unsupervised clustering of the whole data? compare with organisation classification/age/size/geography

## Data sets to answer the short-term research questions

https://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/7ef067c4-07a8-4882-ade3-643d00fd6c49

The following .csv files might be useful (Attention: the headers are numbers, referring to fields in a form. Elizabeth to send document to Michael explaining these.)
- Identification: web site, business number. But does have categorisation according to CRA.
- Financial Data: this is the "meat". 
- Compensation: data about compensation.
- Non-cash gifts received (header "Gifts in Kind" in the PDF description)



Ignore: 
- activities outside of Canada...


## Long-term research questions (To be presented later)

- How does the SDG taxonomy compare with one machine learned by unsupervised clustering?
  - In particular, how are the "a priori" / "social science" classifiers of charities represented / distributed in the machine-created clusters?
- how do changes in board composition affect giving patterns?
